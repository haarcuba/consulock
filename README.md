# Consulock

Consulock is a Python interface for managing a shared resource (i.e. shared by
many processes on different machines) based on the
[consul](https://www.consul.io/) framework.

Consulock is a simple lock abstraction supporting `acquire`, `release` and some other actions appropriate to the consul framework.

# TODO

I will write more documentation in the future, for the time being, check out the unit tests.
